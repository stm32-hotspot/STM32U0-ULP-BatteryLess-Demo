### Related [**STM32 wiki article**](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/How_to_develop_ultra-low-power_and_battery_less_demo_with_STM32U0_MCUs).

This project is the project of the **battery less demo with STM32U0**.

It contains two main sub-projects: 
- The full project of the **Data-Logger-and-Transmission-Module**, developped with **IAR 9.30**.
- Incomplete project of the **Receiver-and-Display-Module** , developped with **IAR 8.50**. The middleware generated by TouchGFX is not included for licensing reasons. Detailed steps on how to add this middleware is explained in the wiki article.

It also contains one additional project:
- The full project of the TouchGFX Designer display (**XTRA_Display-TouchGFX-project**), from which the display part of the **Receiver-and-Display-Module** is based. It was developped with **TouchGFX 4.24.0 Designer**.
